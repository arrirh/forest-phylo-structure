Abarema macradenia;Accepted;Abarema macradenia;pit1ma;Fabaceae-mimosoideae;(Pittier) Barneby & J.W. Grimes;Formerly Pithecellobium macradenium and appeared in 1996 paper under that old name. Pithecellobium was an enormously broad mix of of many taxa. Barnebey and Grimes (1996) did a detailed phylogeny of Ingeae, many of which (except Inga and Calliandra) were once Pithecellobium. The genus revisions do not alter species boundaries here.

Alibertia dwyeri;Accepted;Alibertia dwyeri;boropa;Rubiaceae;Delprete & C.H.Perss.;Formerly B. panamensis. Entire genus of Borojoa, with 3 species, collapsed into Alibertia, without any changes in species boundaries. The name dwyeri was necessary because there is another A. panamensis. There was a single sapling in this taxon since 1982 (died in 2015), but the name is not in Croat nor the 1996 paper. It must have been identified later?

Apeiba aspera;Obsolete;Apeiba membranacea;apeime;Malvaceae;Aubl.;Much confusion about identification of Apeiba glabra/membranacea/aspera. A. aspera is invalid. A. glabra is only Brazil and Guiana Shield. The BCI species is A. membrancea, but we mistakenly took this name from 2004 through 2015.
Apeiba hybrid;Accepted;Apeiba hybrid;apeihy;Malvaceae;;
Apeiba membranacea;Accepted;Apeiba membranacea;apeime;Malvaceae;Spruce ex Benth.;This is Croat's name and is the accepted name for a widespread Central and South American species. But A. membranacea has regularly been misidentified as A. aspera, leading us to use that incorrect name for a period. We used A. membranaceae correctly through the 1996 paper, but then the incorrect A. aspera in the 2004 paper. We have now restored the correct A. membranacea.

Appunia seibertii;Accepted;Appunia seibertii;appuse;Rubiaceae;Standl.;"Not in Croat but identified in 1982 census, and we used in the 1996 paper; now we have reverted to it as of 2017. Steyermark (1972) and Taylor and Steyermark (Flora of NG Shield) moved Appunia within a broad Morinda, but others, however, maintained Appunia separate. Later DNA phylogeny (Razafimandimbison 2009, 2011) shows Morinda to be polyphyletic. They decided to restore Appunia, and Tropicos follows this latest. "
Ardisia bartlettii;Accepted;Ardisia bartlettii;ardiba;Myrsinaceae;Lundell;
Ardisia fendleri;Obsolete;Ardisia standleyana;ardife;Myrsinaceae;Lundell;This taxon in Ardisia is in a state of confusion. Croat used this name, and we published it in both 1996 and 2004 papers. However, Pipoly reidentified one BCI specimen as A. standleyana in the 1980s, Fl. Nic. and Man CR use A. standleyana. However, Ricketson and Pipoly reverted most BCI specimens to A. fendleri since 2006. 
Ardisia guianensis;Accepted;Ardisia guianensis;ardigu;Myrsinaceae;(Aubl.) Mez;
Ardisia standleyana;Accepted;Ardisia standleyana;ardife;Myrsinaceae;P.H.Allen;This was formely A. fendleri, and appeared as that old name in 1996 and 2004 papers. We switched to A. standleyana subsequently. There is confusion, though, as Ricketson and Pipoly reverted most BCI specimens to A. fendleri after 2006. Moreover, A. copeyana appears on one BCI specimen, though it is otherwise only at high elevation. Must check Man. CR and Fl. Nic.
Aspidosperma cruenta;Obsolete;Aspidosperma desmanthum;aspicr;Apocynaceae;;This was Croat’s name. It is a misspelling of A. cruentum, and we repeated the error in 1996 paper but corrected in 2004 paper.
Aspidosperma cruentum;Obsolete;Aspidosperma desmanthum;aspicr;Apocynaceae;Woodson;This is the correct spelling of Croat’s name (he wrote A. cruenta), and we had it correct in 2004 paper. This became A. spruceanum for a time, then A. desmanthum, but returns to A. cruentum as of 2018.
Aspidosperma desmanthum;Accepted;Aspidosperma desmanthum;aspicr;Apocynaceae;;This genus is now in a state of confusion, largely because a PhD dissertation finished in 1999 (K. Potgieter), which makes many revisions, has not been published, so multiple names are still around. Potgieter advises that A. desmanthum should be used for the common BCI species. In the past, we used three other names: A. cruenta, A. cruentum, and A. spruceanum. The first is a misspelling, following Croat, and we published it in both the 1996 and 2004 papers. To put a cap on this, confusion goes full circle in 2018, with Morales restoring A. cruentum to Panama records, including BCI, contra Potgieter.
Aspidosperma spruceanum;Obsolete;Aspidosperma desmanthum;aspicr;Apocynaceae;Benth. ex Müll.Arg.;From as early as 1989, this name replaced A. cruentum for BCI specimens, mostly by Morales (see also Fl. Nic.). We started using it after 2004 in our database, but both 1996 and 2004 papers used the old misspelling, A. cruenta.

Attalea butyracea;Obsolete;Attalea rostrata;sch1zo;Arecaceae;(Mutis ex L.f.) Wess.Boer;"We originally called this Scheelea zonensis, following Croat, and used that name in the 1996 paper. Henderson subsumed Scheelea under Attalea, and also merged the C. America species (A. rostrata) with the S. American A. butyracea; we used the latter in the 2004 paper. Foster (pers. comm.) believes they are distinct in habitat, but otherwise similar. Garwood (2009) treats the BCI species as A. rostrata, but Tropicos treats all as butyracea"
Attalea rostrata;Accepted;Attalea rostrata;sch1zo;Arecaceae;Oerst.;Formerly Scheelea zonensis, and we published under that name in 1996 paper, then A. butyracea, which we used in 2004 paper. We are following Garwood, who used A. rostrata, the Central American form, distinct from S. American A. butyracea. Note that Tropicos still uses A. butyracea.

Beilschmiedia pendula;Obsolete;Beilschmiedia tovarensis;beilpe;Lauraceae;(Sw.) Hemsl.;Croat's identification, and the name we used for 30 years, including 1996 and 2004 paper. Reidentified as B. tovarensis in Nishida (1999) but we didn’t discover the change until later.
Beilschmiedia tovarensis;Accepted;Beilschmiedia tovarensis;beilpe;Lauraceae;(Klotzsch & H.Karst. ex Meisn.) Sachiko Nishida;We called this B. pendula for 30 years, and it appears under that name in 1996 and 2004 papers. But Nishida (1999) lists BCI specimens under B. tovarensis. He explains details of the differences at length, and they are subtle.
Bertiera guianensis;Accepted;Bertiera guianensis;bertgu;Rubiaceae;Aubl.;
Bombacopsis quinata;Obsolete;Pochota quinata;pochqu;Malvaceae;;This was Croat’s name and we used it at the outset. Bombacopis has been in use for 100 years, but it has been debated about whether it is a synonym of Pochota or later, Pachira. Now this is back to Pochota quinata.
Bombacopsis sessilis;Obsolete;Pachira sessilis;pochse;Malvaceae;;This was Croat’s name and we used it in 1982. Bombacopsis has been in use for 100 years, but it has been debated about whether it is a synonym of Pochota or later, Pachira. Now this is Pachira sessilis. See notes with Pachira quinata.
Borojoa panamensis;Obsolete;Alibertia dwyeri;boropa;Rubiaceae;Dwyer;Entire genus of Borojoa, with 3 species, collapsed into Alibertia, without any changes in species boundaries. This species has 1 tree in 50-ha plot, but it was not in 1996 paper. Croat does not include Borojoa.

Capparis frondosa;Obsolete;Capparidastrum frondosum;cappfr;Capparaceae;Jacq.;This was Croat's name, and we used in 1996 and 2004 papers. Currently Capparidastrum frondosum. Hall (2008) gives a thorough explanation of phylogeny in Capparis. The old-world species are a separate clade, not close to American. So the American Capparis have been divided into 4 genera. See also Cornejo and Iltis (2008).
Carica cauliflora;Obsolete;Vasconcellea cauliflora;carica;Caricaceae;;Croat’s name for the wild species of papaya, but now moved to genus Vasconcellea (Badillo 2000 in Ernstia). It was not found in the 50-ha until 2010, but we identified in other plots in the 1990s and used this old name then.

Irwin and Barneby 1982 split Cassia into 3 genera, including Senna, and we had switched to S. dariensis by the late 1980s. Reviewed in Marazzi, with DNA phylogeny confirming monophyly of Senna.

Cespedesia macrophylla;Obsolete;Cespedesia spathulata;cespma;Ochnaceae;;Croat's used this name, but he misspelled it Cespedezia macrophylla. Now lumped under C. spathulata. BCI specimens at Tropicos reidentified as C. spathulata in 1992 (Liesner).
Cespedesia spathulata;Accepted;Cespedesia spathulata;cespma;Ochnaceae;(Ruiz & Pav.) Planch.;Formerly C. macrophylla. Cespedesia now considered monotypic, with nine names united under one widespread species. See Fl. Nic. We used the old species name, macrophylla, and Croat’s misspelling of the genus, so published this under Cespedezia macrophylla in both 1996 and 2004 papers.
Cespedezia macrophylla;Obsolete;Cespedesia spathulata;cespma;Ochnaceae;;Croat used this incorrect spelling of Cespedesia macrophylla. We repeated the error in both 1996 and 2004 papers. On top of that, the species epithet was changed to C. spathulata (by 1992 at Tropicos, in 2001 Flora Nic), but we didn’t update our database until after 2004. 
Cestrum megalophyllum;Obsolete;Cestrum schlechtendahlii;cestme;Solanaceae;Dunal;Croat's name and we used in 1996 and 2004 papers. M. Nee (pers. comm.) and Hensold indicate this is a synonym of C. schlechtendahlii. Tropicos agrees. Must check published names (Knapp, Man CR??). Nee reidentified all Croat's BCI specimens as C. schlechtendahlii in 2013. 
Cestrum racemosum;Accepted;Cestrum racemosum;cestra;Solanaceae;Ruiz & Pav.;Croat included this taxon, but it did not appear in the 50-ha plot until the 2015 census.
Cestrum schlechtendahlii;Accepted;Cestrum schlechtendahlii;cestme;Solanaceae;G.Don;We originally followed Croat and used C. megalophyllum in 1996 and 2004 papers. Nee reidentified all Croat's BCI specimens as C. schlechtendahlii in 2013. This is a question of name priority for same species circumpscription?? See Manual CR. 
Chamaedorea tepejilote;Accepted;Chamaedorea tepejilote;cha1te;Arecaceae;Liebm.;Formerly C. wendlandiana, but we switched by the 1996 paper. Lumped by Henderson (1997).
Chamaedorea wendlandiana;Obsolete;Chamaedorea tepejilote;cha1te;Arecaceae;;Croat's original name, and we used it at the outset. By 1996 paper, we had changed to C. tepejilote. Henderson (1997) collapsed several tax into C. tepejilote.
Chamguava schippii;Accepted;Chamguava schippii;cha2sc;Myrtaceae;(Standl.) Landrum;"A small group of 3 rare C. American species, formerly Eugenia, moved to Psidium in 1963, and we initially used Croat’s name, Psidium anglohondurense. The new genus Chamguava was erected in 1991 by Landrum based on embryological details that separate it from Psidium; Chamguava is in a small group with Pimenta. The BCI population is the only one known s. of Guatemala, and one of 3 species only seen 3 times in the 1940s. No change in species boundaries. Huge DNA phylogeny (2015) does not include Chamguava, presumably due to rarity."
Chimarrhis parviflora;Accepted;Chimarrhis parviflora;chimpa;Rubiaceae;Standl.;
Chlorophora tinctoria;Obsolete;Maclura tinctoria;maclti;Moraceae;;Currently Maclura tinctoria, following Berg (2001). The two genus names, Chorophora and Maclura, were used in parallel during the 19th century for the species tinctoria. It was after 1962 that Chlorophora was finally and permanently moved under Maclura. Berg (2001) summarizes. Croat did not have this species under either name. D'Arcy used Chlorophora.
Chrysochlamys eclipes;Accepted;Chrysochlamys eclipes;chr1ec;Clusiaceae;L.O.Williams;We originally followed Croat and used T. nicaraguensis, but now corrected to Chrysochlamys eclipses. We had switched to C. eclipes by 1996 paper, so no publication uses old name. See notes for T. nicaraguensis and Hammel (1999).
Chrysophyllum argenteum;Accepted;Chrysophyllum argenteum;chr2ar;Sapotaceae;Jacq.;We used this name by 1996 and 2004 papers. In Croat, this was Cynodendron panamense, but Pennington (1990) lumped several species under C. argenteum as a subspecies. The name Chrysophyllum panamense has also been used, but never in our data.
Chrysophyllum cainito;Accepted;Chrysophyllum cainito;chr2ca;Sapotaceae;L.;Pennington (1990) is certain this is not native to Panama.
Chrysophyllum panamense;Obsolete;Chrysophyllum argenteum;chr2ar;Sapotaceae;;Synonym of Cynodendron panamense that we used briefly in 1980s. This became C. argenteum subsp. panamense in Pennington's monograph (1990), and we used Chr. argenteum in all publications.
Cinnamomum triplinerve;Accepted;Cinnamomum triplinerve;phoeci;Lauraceae;(Ruiz & Pav.) Kosterm.;This was formerly Phoebe cinnamomifolia, and appeared as such in 1996 and 2004 papers. Croat called in P. mexicanum. See Fl. Nic.

Coccoloba coronata;Accepted;Coccoloba coronata;coccco;Polygonaceae;Jacq.;
Coccoloba manzanillensis;Obsolete;Coccoloba manzinellensis;coccma;Polygonaceae;;This is Croat's misspelling of C. manzinellensis. We propagated the misspelling in the 1996 paper, but corrected it by the 2004 paper.
Coccoloba manzinellensis;Accepted;Coccoloba manzinellensis;coccma;Polygonaceae;Beurl.;We spelled this incorrectly in 1996, copying Croat's error C. manzanellensis. We propagated the misspelling in the 1996 paper, but corrected it by the 2004 paper.
Cojoba rufescens;Accepted;Cojoba rufescens;pit1ru;Fabaceae-mimosoideae;(Benth.) Britton & Rose;Formerly Pithecellobium rufescens, and appears as such in 1996 paper. But Pithecellobium was an enormously broad mix of of many taxa. Barnebey and Grimes (1996) did a detailed phylogeny of Ingeae, many of which (except Inga and Calliandra) were once Pithecellobium. Cojoba is related to Inga and Calliandra according to Barneby and Grimes. The genus revisions do not alter species boundaries here.

Crematosperma sp.;Obsolete;Mosannona garwoodii;malmsp;Annonaceae;;Croat mentions this species as rare, citing a Garwood and Foster specimen, and likely new to science, but he misspelled the genus. It turned out to be very common in the 50-ha plot. We published as Malmea sp. nov. in 1996, then the final Mosannona garwoodii in 2004.

Cupania seemannii;Accepted;Cupania seemannii;cupasy;Sapindaceae;Triana & Planch.;Seemann himself named it C. sylvatica in 1853 (Voyage of the Heald), however in 1862 Triana and Planch changed to C. seemanni saying C. sylvatica was already in use for a Brazilian specimen. But Croat used the old C. sylvatica, though he indicated C. seemannii as a synonym.
Cupania sylvatica;Obsolete;Cupania seemannii;cupasy;Sapindaceae;;Croat used this name, and we used it in 1996 and 2004 papers. But this was wrong, and C. seemannii has been valid for 150 years.
Cyathea petiolata;Accepted;Cyathea petiolata;cnempe;Cyatheaceae;(Hook.) R.M. Tryon;DNA phylogenies of tree ferns rearranged much traditional taxonomy. Cnemidaria is nested within Cyathea. No change species boundary.
Cynodendron panamense;Obsolete;Chrysophyllum argenteum;chr2ar;Sapotaceae;(Pittier) Aubrév.;Croat's name, but we had switched to Chrysophyllum panamense by start of 50-ha plot. Yet another taxonomic revision followed, and this appears as Chrysophyllum argenteum in 1996 and 2004 papers. Pennington (1990) placed Cynodendron within Chrysophyllum. Older treatments of Sapotaceae have gone back and forth on this, indeed, Croat lists Chrysophyllum panamense as a synonym. Morever, Pennington moved C. panamense under the widely distributed Chrysophyllum argenteum.
Cyphomandra hartwegii;Obsolete;Solanum circinatum;cyphha;Solanaceae;;Croat’s name, we used it through the 1996 paper. Now known as Solanum circinatum. Bohs (1995) collapsed entire genus Cyphomandra into Solanum with no changes in species boundaries. 
Damburneya umbrosa;Accepted;Damburneya umbrosa;nectpu;Lauraceae;(Kunth) Trofimov;One group of Nectandra now split into this genus, an old name that had been subsumed into Nectandra, now resurrected on molecular results. This was originally Nectandra purpurea, reidentified as N. umbrosa, but the latter never go into the database (for BCI specimens, but yes for one at Sherman) or any publication. 
Dendropanax arboreus;Accepted;Dendropanax arboreus;dendar;Araliaceae;(L.) Decne. & Planch.;What we currently call all Dendropanax in the 50-ha plot, but variation may require 4 species. Some D. arboreus at BCI now recognized as D. caucanus by Cannon, or D. concinnus by N. Hensold (the latter not valid according to Tropicos). See Cannon and Cannon (1989) about variability of widespread D. arboreus, and Hensold suggests hybridization or introgression might be blurring boundaries. The group requires revision, and individuals within the plot may need to be divided. Garwood supports a division of Croat's D. arboreus into D. caucanus and D. arboreus. See also notes with D. stenodontus about yet another possible taxon.
Dendropanax stenodontus;Obsolete;Dendropanax arboreus;dendst;Araliaceae;;Croat's key indicates differences between this and D. arboreus (adult size, leaf dentition), and Foster originally separated many individuals under this name. In 1996 paper, both D. stenodontus and D. arboreus appear. After that, we lumped all under D. arboreus. Cannon and Cannon are inconclusive about whether there might be a small-stature species, but D. stenodontus would not be the correct name. Possibly D. maritimus.
Desmopsis panamensis;Accepted;Desmopsis panamensis;des2pa;Annonaceae;(B.L.Rob.) Saff.;
Didymopanax morototoni;Obsolete;Schefflera morototoni;sch2mo;Araliaceae;;The name in Croat, and we used this at the very beginning of the 50-ha censuses. Now Schefflera morotoni, and we had made the change by the late 1980s. The entire genus Didymopanax was collapsed into Schefflera (Frodin 1975), which is interestingly prior to the date of Croat's book.

Dipteryx oleifera;Accepted;Dipteryx oleifera;diptpa;Fabaceae-papilionoideae;Benth.;Formerly D. panamensis. The two names appear to be used interchangeably for a species collected from Nicaragua through the Colombian choco, plus one in Ecuador. At Tropicos, de Lima named BCI specimens D. oleifera in 1986, but Klitgaard renamed D. panamensis in 2007. D. oleifera is the early name, but without specimens. The rules committee voted to accept it (Brummitt 2011).
Dipteryx panamensis;Obsolete;Dipteryx oleifera;diptpa;Fabaceae-papilionoideae;;Croat's name, and we used it in 1996 paper. We have now switched to D. oleifera, though Fl Meso online is back to D. panamensis. Zamora (2010) uses D. panamensis but adds that D. oleifera might be correct.

Erythroxylum macrophyllum;Accepted;Erythroxylum macrophyllum;ery2ma;Erythroxylaceae;Cav.;Formerly E. multiflorum, a name from Canal Area in 1940. Plowman synonomized it and other local names under the widespread and variable E. macrophyllum. See also Hammel et al (2010) treating E. multiflorum under this. Appendix of 1996 paper failed to list E. multiflorum as Croat’s name for this taxa.
Erythroxylum multiflorum;Obsolete;Erythroxylum macrophyllum;ery2ma;Erythroxylaceae;;Croat’s name, but we had switched to E. macrophyllum in 1996 and 2004 papers, following Plowman1991. But Plowman acknowledges that E. multiflorum is distinctive, close to E. macrophyllum skutchii in Costa Rica and two other large-leaved subspecies of E. macrophyllum in S. America.

Ficus aurea;Obsolete;Ficus trigonata;ficutr;Moraceae;Nutt.;"We used F. trigonata at least until 1996 paper, but F. aurea replaced it. This is a mistake; it's the Florida species and is not known on BCI (but is in western Panama). "
Ficus bullenei;Obsolete;Ficus matiziana;ficubu;Moraceae;I.M.Johnst.;Croat’s name, and we used it 1996 and 2004 papers. Berg (2009) synonomized with F. matiziana, a S. American species. Garwood (2009) continued with F. bullenei.

We then mistakely listed as F. aurea for several years. Garwood uses trigonata, but indicates a complex of distinct types. However, now Berg says Panama specimens should be F. crocata and that F. trigonata is restricted to the Antilles; he describes variation in detail."
Ficus trigonta;Obsolete;Ficus trigonata;ficutr;Moraceae;;A publishing typo for F. trigonata in our 1996 paper.
Ficus yoponensis;Accepted;Ficus yoponensis;ficuyo;Moraceae;Desv.;
Garcinia intermedia;Obsolete;Garcinia recondita;gar2in;Clusiaceae;(Pittier) Hammel;Croat used the old name Rheedia edulis. Became Garcinia intermedia after Hammel (1989), who summarized various studies showing that Rheedia cannot be separated from Garcinia. As of 2015, however, G. intermedia at BCI was moved to G. recondita (see notes there).
Garcinia madruno;Accepted;Garcinia madruno;gar2ma;Clusiaceae;(Kunth) Hammel;Formerly R. acuminata. See notes for G. intermedia and Hammel (1989). We had switched before 1996, so this is in 1996 and 2004 papers.
Garcinia recondita;Accepted;Garcinia recondita;gar2in;Clusiaceae;Hammel;Hammel described this species around 2015, though still not published (Hammel pers. comm.). All BCI specimens of R. edulis/G. intermedia now identified at Tropicos as G. recondita, but G. intermedia remains valid elsewhere in Panama.

Guapira standleyana;Accepted;Guapira standleyana;guapst;Nyctaginaceae;Woodson;We misspelled this G. standleyanum in the 1996 paper, copying the error from Croat.
Guapira standleyanum;Obsolete;Guapira standleyana;guapst;Nyctaginaceae;;We used this misspelling from Croat for many years, and the name is spelled wrong in the 1996 paper. It should be G. standleyana.
Guarea bullata;Accepted;Guarea bullata;guarsp;Meliaceae;Radlk.;We finally identified the fuzzy-leaved Guarea morphospecies as this after 2004. G. bullata has been known in other parts of Panama since at least the 1960s. Impressed venation is distinctive, otherwise very similar and closely related to G. glabra.
Guarea fuzzy;Obsolete;Guarea bullata;guarsp;Meliaceae;;Our temporary name for a Guarea with pubescent leaves in the 50 ha plot, by far the most abundant of unnamed morphospecies in the initial census. It is not at all like the two other Guarea on BCI. Finally identified as G. bullata,
Guarea grandifolia;Accepted;Guarea grandifolia;guargr;Meliaceae;(L.) Sleumer;BCI specimens of G. multiflora were renamed this before plot started (Pennington in 1979 on Mobot sheets, eg Croat 8443, 11300).
Guarea guidonia;Accepted;Guarea guidonia;guargu;Meliaceae;(L.) Sleumer;"Identified as G. glabra in Croat. Foster reidentified by 1981; G. glabra should have glabrous ovary and few lenticels, small flowers relative to G. guidonia. "
Guarea multiflora;Obsolete;Guarea grandifolia;guargr;Meliaceae;Adr. Juss.;"Croat's name for the large-leaved Guarea we call G. grandifolia in the 50-ha plot. We never used G. multiflora because Pennington re-identified Croat's BCI specimens in 1979. G. multiflora was named in Juisseau (1830) without any specimen or location; one of two Mobot specimens is a liana!. It does not appear in Pennington (2013), even the appendix."
Guarea sp. 1;Obsolete;Guarea bullata;guarsp;Meliaceae;;Alternate name for G. fuzzy, later identified as G. bullata, used in Condit et al. (2004). Unfortunate, because Guarea sp.1 was applied to a species in plot 33 in 1996 and is still in use.
Guarea sp. nov.;Obsolete;Guarea bullata;guarsp;Meliaceae;;Alternate name for G. fuzzy, later identified as G. bullata, used in Condit et al. (1996). This mistakenly suggests we thought it would be a newly named species, but it turned out not to be.
Guatteria dumetorum;Obsolete;Guatteria lucens;guatdu;Annonaceae;R.E.Fr.;Croat's name, and we followed for 30 years, appearing in 1996 and 2004 papers.. Maas (2015) decided to lump with G. lucens. 
Guatteria lucens;Accepted;Guatteria lucens;guatdu;Annonaceae;Standl.;We knew this as G. dumetorum for 30 years, and see notes there. Maas (2015) provides details about slight leaf differences between the dumetorum type and lucens type, but indicates that in all other ways the two are indistringuishable. Both types also have the same range, in Costa Rica and Panama, so though the species circumscription was widened by lumping, the range was not.

Heisteria acuminata;Accepted;Heisteria acuminata;heisac;Erythropalaceae;(Humb. & Bonpl.) Engl.;Known as H. longipes in Croat, but we used this name from the very start, and it appears in both 1996 and 2004 paper use this. Sleumer explains that Heisteria are not identifiable based only on flowers or fruits and leaves are needed. He collapsed many local species under H. acuminata, and all Tropicos specimens formerly called H. longipes now identified as H. acuminata by S. Knapp, R. Liesner, H. Sleumer.
Heisteria concinna;Accepted;Heisteria concinna;heisco;Erythropalaceae;Standl.;
Heisteria longipes;Obsolete;Heisteria acuminata;heisac;Erythropalaceae;Standl.;Croat's name, following Standley for Panama specimens. He describes range as Colombia-Costa Rica. Sleumer monograph lumps under H. acuminata after viewing many BCI specimens. We never used this name.

Hieronyma alchorneoides;Accepted;Hieronyma alchorneoides;hyeral;Euphorbiaceae;Allemão;Franco reidentified BCI specimens in 1989 and published a major revision, collapsing H. laxiflora and other widespread varieties. Major broadening of range, however many local names are still listed as valid at Tropicos. Franco recognizes two varieties of H. alchorneoides, both among Croat's BCI specimens, but this is stipule difference between adults and juveniles (Hensold).

Hybanthus prunifolius;Obsolete;Pombalia prunifolia;hybapr;Violaceae;(Humb. & Bonpl. ex Schult.) Schulze-Menz;Croat's name, and we used for 35 years and published in 1996 and 2004. de Paula Souza and Ballard (2014) revised Hybanthus based on polyphyly shown by DNA phylogeny. Several new genera will be needed. 
Hyeronima alcheornoides;Obsolete;Hieronyma alchorneoides;hyeral;Euphorbiaceae;;This is an unfortunate typo in the 1996 paper. The species name should be alchorneoides. Separately, the genus should be Hieronyma, but this error follows Croat. See notes with Hyeronima laxiflora.
Hyeronima laxiflora;Obsolete;Hieronyma alchorneoides;hyeral;Euphorbiaceae;;Croat's name, note misspelling of genus (an old problem due to two spellings in original description). We originally used this name in 50-ha plot. Franco1990 synonomized under H. alchorneoides.
Inga acuminata;Accepted;Inga acuminata;ingas1;Fabaceae-mimosoideae;Benth.;Originally censused as Inga skinny, an unidentified morphospecies. Croat did not include this species, and we finally got it identified in 1989 (Zamora). It was not (??) known in Panama until then. We had it as I. acuminata in the 1996 paper.
Inga cocleensis;Accepted;Inga cocleensis;ingaco;Fabaceae-mimosoideae;Pittier;The identification of this species in the 50-ha plot has been reassessed. See detailed notes under I. thibaudiana and I. unidentified.
Inga fagifolia;Obsolete;Inga laurina;ingafa;Fabaceae-mimosoideae;;We followed Croat and used this name at the outset, and it appears in the 1996 paper. Now synonomized with I. laurina, following Pennington's (1997) revision of the entire genus, and I. laurina appears in the 2004 paper. Tropicos specimens from BCI identified as I. laurina by Sousan in 1990 or Pennington in 1996.

Inga marginata;Accepted;Inga marginata;ingama;Fabaceae-mimosoideae;Willd.;
Inga minutula;Obsolete;Inga oerstediana;ingami;Fabaceae-mimosoideae;;We followed Croat and used this name at the outset, and it appears in the 1996 paper. Now synonomized with I. oerstediana in Pennington's (1997). Tropicos specimens from BCI identified as I. oerstediana by Sousan in 1990.
Inga mucuna;Accepted;Inga mucuna;ingam1;Fabaceae-mimosoideae;Walp. & Duchass.;
Inga nobilis;Accepted;Inga nobilis;ingaqu;Fabaceae-mimosoideae;Willd.;Originally I. quaternata, following Croat, but we now follow Pennington (1997), in which I. quaternata was synonomized with I. nobilis. In 2004 paper, we had changed to this. C. American specimens are subsp. quaternata, and S. American are subsp. nobilis, but Pennington explains that there are intermediates in between and sometime one plant mixes the two different flower forms. We used I. quaternata in the 1996 paper but I. nobilis in the 2004 paper. See notes on recent confusion under I. quaternata.
Inga oerstediana;Accepted;Inga oerstediana;ingami;Fabaceae-mimosoideae;Benth.;Originally I. minutula, following Croat, and appeared as such in the 1996 paper. Pennington's (1997) synonomized I. minutula under I. oerstediana, and Tropicos BCI specimens were identified as I. oerstediana in 1990 (Sousa). I. oerstediana is closely related to and possibly conspecific with I. edulis.
Inga pavoniana;Obsolete;Inga sapindoides;ingasa;Fabaceae-mimosoideae;;A name appearing at Tropicos now, along with I. marginata.. It is accepted by Sousa (1993), and C. Romero applies at Tropicos. But N. Hensold points out I. marginata has priority, and Pennington and Man CR both use the latter.

I. quaternata was synonomized with I. nobilis in Pennington's (1997) revision of the entire genus, and use I. nobilis in 2004 paper. Confusion remains, though, with the name I. quaternata still appearing: Tropicos specimens from BCI identified as I. quaternata by C. Romero in 2006.  Note confusion also in Zamora (2010), mentioning both names I. nobilis subsp. quaternata and I. quaternata as if they are distinct taxa.
Inga ruiziana;Accepted;Inga ruiziana;ingaru;Fabaceae-mimosoideae;G.Don;
Inga sapindoides;Accepted;Inga sapindoides;ingasa;Fabaceae-mimosoideae;Willd.;Sousa (1993) argues that I. pavoniana should be used, because original specimen of I. sapindoides lacked flowers and is questionable. Tropicos specimens IDed by C. Romero in 2006 as I. pavoniana (also R. Gereult in 1994). Pennington synonomizes the latter under I. sapindoides and has no discussion of the problem.
Inga semialata;Obsolete;Inga marginata;ingama;Fabaceae-mimosoideae;;A name in use at Tropicos because Sousa uses it, but Pennington and Man CR use I. marginata. N. Henshold says I. marginata has precedence.
Inga skinny;Obsolete;Inga acuminata;ingas1;Fabaceae-mimosoideae;;An Inga with narrow leaflets not identified in the first census. In 1989, identified as I. acuminata. 
Inga spectabilis;Accepted;Inga spectabilis;ingasp;Fabaceae-mimosoideae;(Vahl) Willd.;
Inga thibaudiana;Accepted;Inga thibaudiana;ingath;Fabaceae-mimosoideae;DC.;Included in Croat, but not recognized in the 50-ha plot until 2005, when it was separated from I. coclensis for the first time. Many trees previously known as I. coclensis had been alive since 1982, so we know that I. thibaudiana has always been part of the 50-ha plot.

Lonchocarpus heptaphyllus;Accepted;Lonchocarpus heptaphyllus;loncla;Fabaceae-papilionoideae;(Poir.) DC.;The species appears as L. latifolia in the 1996 paper then L. latifolius in the 2004 paper (the latter is correct). Croat knew this as L. pentaphyllus. Zamora2010a synonomized L. latifolius under this.
Lonchocarpus latifolia;Obsolete;Lonchocarpus heptaphyllus;loncla;Fabaceae-papilionoideae;;An incorrect spelling for L. latifolius that we used in the 1996 paper. But that name is now obsolete, and this goes by L. heptaphyllus.
Lonchocarpus latifolius;Obsolete;Lonchocarpus heptaphyllus;loncla;Fabaceae-papilionoideae;;This was our first name for the Lonchocarpus species in the 50-ha plot. Croat knew it as L. pentaphyllus. Zamora (2010) synonomized L. latifolius and L. pentaphyllus under L. heptaphyllus.
Lonchocarpus pentaphyllus;Obsolete;Lonchocarpus heptaphyllus;loncla;Fabaceae-papilionoideae;(Poir.) DC.;Croat’s name, now considered a synonym of L. heptaphyllus (Zamora 2010). 
Lopimia dasypetala;Obsolete;Pavonia dasypetala;lopida;Malvaceae;;This was Croat's name, and we used in both 1996 and 2004 papers. Now considered Pavonia dasypetala. Lopimia was described in 1823, but frequently treated under Pavonia since the 19th century. Differs in mucilage on fruits. No Pavonia DNA phylogeny is available.

Neither name appears in Croat, and D'Arcy used Chlorophora. Our brief use of Chorophora was erroneous, since  Berg's (2001) monograph clearly used Maclura.
Macrocnemum glabrescens;Obsolete;Macrocnemum roseum;macrgl;Rubiaceae;;Croat's name and our original name, appearing in 1996 paper. Changed to M. roseum after 2000.
Macrocnemum roseum;Accepted;Macrocnemum roseum;macrgl;Rubiaceae;(Ruiz & Pav.) Wedd.;Formerly M. glabrescens, but that C. American form was lumped under this widespread S. American species (Taylor pers. comm.). Appears as M. glabrescens in 1996 paper. [I need Lorence 1999 on C. American Rubiaceae.]
Malmea garwood's;Obsolete;Mosannona garwoodii;malmsp;Annonaceae;;One name used in some early databases for the new Annonaceae, christened finally as a novel species, Mosannona garwoodii. 
Malmea Nancy??;Obsolete;Mosannona garwoodii;malmsp;Annonaceae;;One name used in some early databases for the new Annonaceae, christened finally as a novel species, Mosannona garwoodii. For a period in the early censuses, we thought it might be a novel Malmea.

Malpighia romeroana;Accepted;Malpighia romeroana;malpro;Malpighiaceae;Cuatrec.;
Maquira costaricana;Obsolete;Maquira guianensis;maquco;Moraceae;;We took this name from Croat and used through the 1996 paper, but switched to M. guianensis for 2004 paper, following Berg (1972). With more specimens of M. guianensis from Ecuador, Berg could no longer separate M. costaricensus (Ecuador and north) and M. guianensis (across S. America). Now, Berg (2001) considers the former a subspecies of the latter. 
Maquira guianensis;Accepted;Maquira guianensis;maquco;Moraceae;Aubl.;Formerly M. costaricana. We switched after Berg (2001), and the 2004 paper used M. guianensis. See notes with M. costaricana.
Margaritaria nobilis;Accepted;Margaritaria nobilis;margno;Phyllanthaceae;L.f.;Croat includes this taxon on BCI, but we did not identify in the 50-ha plot until 1990. A few individuals were in the census from the start, but remained unidentified until then.

Morinda seibertii;Obsolete;Appunia seibertii;appuse;Rubiaceae;(Standl.) Steyerm.;We originally used Appunia seibertii, but then followed Steyermark (1972) in moving Appunia within the broad Morinda. But recent DNA phylogeny reinstated Appunia. See more notes there.
Mosannona garwoodii;Accepted;Mosannona garwoodii;malmsp;Annonaceae;Chatrou & Welzenis;The official species name, maintaining Nancy Garwood's, described by Chatrou (1998). This correct version appeared in our 2004 paper. The species was thus first described from the BCI 50-ha plot. It is very distinctive, and common in the plot. It had several morphospecies names before the final description, including the genera Malmea and Cremastosperma. Croat called in Crematosperma sp., misspelling the genus.
Mosannona garwoods;Obsolete;Mosannona garwoodii;malmsp;Annonaceae;;One briefly used name for the new Annonaceae, after P. Maas saw it and placed it in a new Neotropical genus. Chatrou (1998) eventually christened it as a novel species, Mosannona garwoodii.
Mouriri myrtilloides;Accepted;Mouriri myrtilloides;mourmy;Melastomataceae;(Sw.) Poir.;
Myrcia gatunensis;Obsolete;Myrcia splendens tip. gatunensis;myrcga;Myrtaceae;Standl.;The name from Croat, and we used in 1996 paper and onward until 2017. Tropicos, citing Flora Mesoamerica and Flora Costa Rica, merges into M. splendens, a very widespread neotropical species. FMNH specimens also use M. splendens, det by Kawasaki 2005. But we have M. splendens separate (formerly myrc3), including many individuals of M. gatunensis and M. splendens together in plot 6. Kawasaki (pers. comm.) acknowledges that M. splendens is variable and needs revision. For now, we maintain M. gatunensis.
Myrcia splendens tip. gatunensis;Accepted;Myrcia splendens tip. gatunensis;myrcga;Myrtaceae;(Sw.) DC.;See sp.3, the morphospecies eventually identified as this. See also M. gatunensis, whose BCI specimens are now identified as M. splendens. However, plot 6 has many individuals of both this species and M. gatunensis growing side by side.

Nectandra cissiflora;Accepted;Nectandra cissiflora;nectci;Lauraceae;Nees;
Nectandra fuzzy;Accepted;Nectandra fuzzy;nects1;Lauraceae;;An unidentified Lauraceae, tentatively placed in genus Nectandra. We have most consistently called it Nectandra fuzzy, but it was listed as Nectandra sp. nov. 1 in the 1996 paper, though we are not certain it's a novel species. The 50-ha plot has 11 individuals assigned the name. 
Nectandra globosa;Obsolete;Nectandra lineata;nectgl;Lauraceae;;This is Croat's name, and we originally used it. But Croat's BCI specimens are now identified as N. lineata (Rohwer 1993). N. globosa is valid but only occurs in Guyana. We used N. globosa in the 1996 paper, but the corrected N. lineata in the 2004 paper. 
Nectandra lineata;Accepted;Nectandra lineata;nectgl;Lauraceae;(Kunth) Rohwer;Our current identification for this Nectandra, following Rohwer (1993) who explains the source of Croat's mistaken identifcation as N. globosa.
Nectandra purpurascens;Obsolete;Damburneya umbrosa;nectpu;Lauraceae;(Ruiz & Pav.) Mez;Croat used this name, but it is an error. Authority given by Croat matches that of N. purpurea, so Rowher assumed that's what Croat meant.
Nectandra purpurea;Obsolete;Damburneya umbrosa;nectpu;Lauraceae;(Ruiz & Pav.) Mez;We used this in 1996 and 2004 papers, following but correcting Croat's name (he mispelled it as N. purpurascens). But Rohwer (1993) identified BCI specimens as N. umbrosa (N. purpurea is valid, and similar, but not on BCI).  As of 2016, though, this section of Nectandra was moved into genus Damburneya, so now we call it D. umbrosa. Note, however, that van der Werff in 2016 IDed Croat 5053 from BCI as D. purpurea at same time as he named all other BCI specimens as D. umbrosa. 
Nectandra savannarum;Obsolete;Damburneya umbrosa;nectpu;Lauraceae;(Standl. & Steyerm.) C.K. Allen;We never used this in 50-ha plot data. Croat used it for a single specimen from BCI (Foster 960 at Tropicos), matching it to a species described in Guatemalan savanna (Allen 1945). That one specimen was later determined (on Tropicos specimen) to be the same as the other common Nectandra (now Damburneya umbrosa, what Croat called N. purpurascens). 
Nectandra sp._4;Obsolete;Nectandra sp.4_(tiny_leaf);nects3;Lauraceae;;
Nectandra sp.4_(tiny_leaf);Accepted;Nectandra sp.4_(tiny_leaf);nects3;Lauraceae;;This extremely rare Lauraceae, with just one individual in the 1982 census of the 50-ha plot, was never identified, and we are not certain it is a Nectandra. The single individual died after 1985 and we have never seen it elsewhere, so it will probably never be identified. It had very small leaves, hence the morphospecies name, but it was listed as Nectandra sp. nov. 3 in the 1996 paper.  The combination of sp. 4 and sp. 3  as parts of the name for the same morphospecies resulted from confusion caused by several other unidentified Nectandra in our Panama database.  
Nectandra sp.nov.1;Obsolete;Nectandra fuzzy;nects1;Lauraceae;;This is an alternative name for the unidentified morphospecies we call Nectandra  fuzzy. It was coined for the 1996 paper to sound more professional than N. fuzzy.
Nectandra sp.nov.3;Obsolete;Nectandra sp.4_(tiny_leaf);nects3;Lauraceae;;This is an alternative name for the unidentified morphospecies we refer to as Nectandra  sp.4_(tiny_leaf) in all databases. It was coined for the 1996 paper. The combination of sp. 4 and sp. 3  as parts of the name for the same morphospecies resulted from confusion caused by several other unidentified Nectandra in our Panama database.  
Nectandra umbrosa;Obsolete;Damburneya umbrosa;nectum;Lauraceae;(Kunth) Mez;Rolando used this name in Santa Rita transect, but he says it is same as BCI specimens with code NECTPU. So all taxa we once called N. purpurea are now Damburneya umbrosa, maintaining code NECTPU. At BCI we never used N. umbrosa, because by the time we discovered Rowher's reidentification of N. purpurea, it had been transferred to the genus Damburneya.

Ocotea puberula;Accepted;Ocotea puberula;ocotpu;Lauraceae;(Rich.) Nees;Croat called this O. pyramidata, but we changed to O. puberula by the late 1980s. Van der Weff had already named BCI specimens O. puberula in 1983. See Van der Werff (2002).
Ocotea pyrimidata;Obsolete;Ocotea puberula;ocotpu;Lauraceae;;Croat's named, and we used at the start of the 50-ha plot. We had switched to O. puberula before 1990, and both 1996 and 2004 papers list it as O. puberula. See notes with O. puberula.
Ocotea skutchii;Obsolete;Ocotea whitei;ocotwh;Lauraceae;;Croat used this name, and we followed Croat at the very beginning. By the late 1980s, we switched to O. whitei, and both 1996 and 2004 paper used O. whitei. Van der Werff (2002) published the synonomy.
Ocotea whitei;Accepted;Ocotea whitei;ocotwh;Lauraceae;Woodson;Croat used O. skutchii, but that name was synonomized soon after his book. See van der Werff (2002), who acknowledged variability of O. whitei.
Oenocarpus mapora;Accepted;Oenocarpus mapora;oenoma;Arecaceae;H.Karst.;Formerly O. panamanus, in Croat and in the first census. 
Oenocarpus mapoura;Obsolete;Oenocarpus mapora;oenoma;Arecaceae;;This is a misspelling of O. mapora that appeared in our 1996 paper. We spelled it correctly in 2004 paper.
Oenocarpus panamanus;Obsolete;Oenocarpus mapora;oenoma;Arecaceae;;Croat's name, a name used only in Costa Rica and Panama. We used it at the start of the 50-ha plot but had switched to O. mapora by the late 1980s. Henderson1997 officially lumped this with the widespread O. mapora, along with several other local names in the genus.
Olmedia aspera;Obsolete;Trophis caucana;olmeas;Moraceae;;Our early name, from Croat, now Trophis caucana. Berg (1972) in early Moraceae monograph separated this as a monotypic genus from its earlier inclusion in Trophis. In Berg (1988, 2001), he reversed, saying that Trophis morphology had expanded with T. involucrata, and the wider variation accommodates Olmedia. 
Oreopanax capitatus;Accepted;Oreopanax capitatus;oreoca;Araliaceae;(Jacq.) Decne. & Planch.;Croat includes this, but it did not appear in the 50-ha plot until 2010. The sole individual then died by 2015.
Ormosia amazonica;Accepted;Ormosia amazonica;ormoam;Fabaceae-papilionoideae;Ducke;Not in Croat but identified in 1982 census.
Ormosia coccinea;Accepted;Ormosia coccinea;ormocr;Fabaceae-papilionoideae;(Aubl.) Jacks.;Current identification for a moderately common tree in the plot. Croat listed this form as O. croatii, an unofficial name, but it has been identified at Tropicos in 1978 (MO Dillon). N. Zamora confirmed in 2007 (pers. Comm. To N. Hensold).
Ormosia croatii;Obsolete;Ormosia coccinea;ormocr;Fabaceae-papilionoideae;;Croat used this name, but it is not a published name. Later, MO Dillon and N. Zamora identified this as O. coccinea.

Pachira quinata;Obsolete;Pochota quinata;pochqu;Malvaceae;(Jacq.) W.S.Alverson;"Croat used Bombacopsis quinata, but by 1996 paper we had updated to Pochota quinata, then we changed to Pachira quinata by 2004 paper. But now we have to go back to Pochota quinata, following a recent DNA phylogeny. This makes the nomenclatural history of this taxon the most confusing of all in our database. The genera Bombacopsis, Pochota, and Pachira have been variously used due to taxonomic disagreement. They were coined in 1916, 1909, and 1775 respectively, and there has been a decades long argument about whether Bombacopsis and Pochota refer to the same plants and which takes precedence. At BCI, we originally followed Croat and used Bombacopsis, but Stevens (1987) argued in favor of Pochota as the earlier name. Subsequently, Alverson (1994) argued that they should all fall within Pachira, because none of the characters used to separate Pochota from Pachira were consistent; he acknowledged they may be separate but more evidence was needed. Sure enough, a DNA phylogeny from 2011 does not support Pachira, unless Eriotheca and Bombax are subsumed, and the genus Pochota was again resurrected for P. quinata (but not P. sessilis, which belongs in Pachira)."
Pachira sessilis;Accepted;Pachira sessilis;pochse;Malvaceae;Benth.;Bombacopsis sessilis according to Croat. In 1996 paper, it appeared as Pochota sessilis, but we updated to Pachira sessilis for 2004 paper. See genus discussion under P. quinata
Palicourea acuminata;Accepted;Palicourea acuminata;psycac;Rubiaceae;(Benth.) Borhidi;Formerly Psychotria acumintata. Several psychotria moved to Palicourea due to improved character understanding (see Psych. acuminata).
Palicourea brachiata;Accepted;Palicourea brachiata;psycb1;Rubiaceae;(Sw.) Borhidi;Formerly Psychotria brachiata, and appearing under that old name in 1996 paper.
Palicourea cuspidata;Obsolete;Palicourea acuminata;psycac;Rubiaceae;(Benth.) Borhidi;This was an error and is now corrected to P. acuminata. The mistake traces to misidentification of Psychotria acuminata as P. cuspidata in Panama (Taylor pers. comm.). When moving the name under Palicourea, we carried the incorrect new combination for a short time. Croat has the correct Psychotria acuminata and mentions the confusion with Psychotria cuspidata.

Pavonia dasypetala;Accepted;Pavonia dasypetala;lopida;Malvaceae;Turcz.;Formerly Lopimia dasypetala, following Croat, but this is the widely accepted classification, placing Lopimia within Pavonia (Fryxell). Hammel et al VI (2007) uses P. dasypetala without even mentioning Lopimia as synonym. This appears under the old L. dasypetala in 1996 and 2004 papers.

Phoebe cinnamomifolia;Obsolete;Cinnamomum triplinerve;phoeci;Lauraceae;;We used this in 1996 and 2004 papers for what Croat called P. mexicanum. We now consider Cinnamomum triplinerve the valid name.
Phoebe cinnamomifolium;Obsolete;Cinnamomum triplinerve;phoeci;Lauraceae;(Kunth) Nees;This is a misspelling that showed up briefly in our database. We spelled it correctly, P. cinnamomifolia, in 1996 and 2004 papers. We now use Cinnamomum triplinerve for this taxon.
Phoebe mexicana;Obsolete;Cinnamomum triplinerve;phoeci;Lauraceae;Meisn.;Croat used this name, but we changed to Phoebe cinnamomifolium for the 1996 and 2004 papers. That too is obsolete though, and we now use is Cinnamomum triplinerve. The combination C. cinnamomifolium has also been used, but never in our database.

Piper carrilloanum;Obsolete;Piper schiedeanum;pipeca;Piperaceae;;This is Croat's name, but Tebbs synonomized with P. schiedeanum in 1990. Most of Croat's BCI specimens are named P. schiedeanum now. We used P. carrilloanum in the 1996 paper. According to Callejas, P. carrilloanum remains a valid species, and in Panama, but not on BCI.
Piper colonense;Accepted;Piper colonense;pipecu;Piperaceae;C.DC.;

Piper culebranum;Obsolete;Piper colonense;pipecu;Piperaceae;;Croat's BCI specimens at Tropicos identified (R. Callejas) as P. culebranum in 2006. However, Tebbs identified them as P. colonense in 1990. Callejas (and Tropicos) consider P. colonense and P. culebranum both valid species, both in central Panama, but BCI specimens are P. culebranum. Our 2004 paper has both species!!
Piper imperiale;Accepted;Piper imperiale;pipeim;Piperaceae;(Miq.) C.DC.;Croat had this correct, and our 1996 paper had it correct. At one point, the misspelling P. imperialis got in our database.

Pithecellobium macradenium;Obsolete;Abarema macradenia;pit1ma;Fabaceae-mimosoideae;;Currently Abarema macradenia. We used the old name in 1996 paper. Barnebey and Grimes (1996) detailed phylogeny of Ingeae reduced Pithecelllobium enormously, and this taxon was transferred to Abarema, as A. macradenia.
Pithecellobium rufescens;Obsolete;Cojoba rufescens;pit1ru;Fabaceae-mimosoideae;;This is Croat’s name, and we used in name in 1996 paper but had updated to Cojoba rufescens in 2004 paper. Barnebey and Grimes (1996) detailed phylogeny of Ingeae reduced Pithecelllobium enormously.

Pourouma bicolor;Accepted;Pourouma bicolor;pourbi;Urticaceae;Mart.;This was P. guianensis in Croat, but we followed Berg and changed to this by the late 1980s. P. bicolor appears in 1996 and 2004 papers. A Tropicos specimen now carries the name P. chocoana, but Berg used P. bicolor subsp. chocoana and this is still accepted everywhere (see Flora Mes, CR).
Pourouma guianensis;Obsolete;Pourouma bicolor;pourbi;Urticaceae;;Croat's name for the BCI Pourouma, and we used it at the outset of the 50-ha plot. Berg identified BCI specimens as P. bicolor subsp. chocoana. P. guianensis remains a valid, S. American taxa. P. guianensis never appeared in publications.
Pouteria fossicola;Accepted;Pouteria fossicola;poutfo;Sapotaceae;Cronquist;
Pouteria reticulata;Accepted;Pouteria reticulata;poutre;Sapotaceae;(Engl.) Eyma;We originally followed Croat and called this P. unilocularis, a C. American taxon. Pennington lumped it and 4 other species, and the combined group is widespread and variable. We switched before any publicacions, so this appears as P. reticulata in both 1996 and 2004 papers.

Pouteria unilocularis;Obsolete;Pouteria reticulata;poutre;Sapotaceae;;Croat used this C. American name, and we followed at the outset of the 50-ha plot. Pennington (1990) recognizes distinctions, but lumped 5 species, including this C. American form, under P. reticulata, and we made the switch by 1990.

Psidium anglohondurense;Obsolete;Chamguava schippii;cha2sc;Myrtaceae;;Croat used this name, and we used this during the 1980s. We switched to Chamguava schippii by the 1996 and 2004 papers, following Landrum’s (1991) revision. See notes with the latter.
Psidium friedrichsthalianum;Accepted;Psidium friedrichsthalianum;psidfr;Myrtaceae;(O.Berg) Nied.;
Psychotria acuminata;Obsolete;Palicourea acuminata;psycac;Rubiaceae;Benth.;This is name that Croat used. C.M. Taylor et al (2015) moved several Psychotria to Palicourea. Taylor (pers. comm.) indicates many past collectors did not correctly understand character differences between genera. Many more Psychotria will be moved. See also Borhidi (2011) about the transfer.
Psychotria brachiata;Obsolete;Palicourea brachiata;psycb1;Rubiaceae;Sw.;This is Croat’s name, and we used in 1996 paper. Moved to Psychotria following Borhidi2011.
Psychotria chagrensis;Accepted;Psychotria chagrensis;psycch;Rubiaceae;Standl.;

Psychotria deflexa;Obsolete;Palicourea deflexa;psycde;Rubiaceae;DC.;This is Croat’s name, and we used in 1996 and 2004 papers. Moved to Psychotria following Borhidi2011.
Psychotria furcata;Obsolete;Palicourea hoffmannseggiana;psycfu;Rubiaceae;;Croat's name and the name appearing in 1996 paper, but we switched to P. hoffmannseggiana, following Burger and Taylor (Flora Costaricensis). This lumps the C. American/Choco P. furcata into a widespread species. As of 2011, this and many other Psychotria were moved under Palicourea.
Psychotria graciliflora;Accepted;Psychotria graciliflora;psycg1;Rubiaceae;Benth.;Not in Croat but identified in 1982 census.
Psychotria granadensis;Obsolete;Psychotria tenuifolia;psycg2;Rubiaceae;;Croat's name and our original name, and we used in the 1996 paper. We later switched to P. tenuifolia following Hamilton (1989) Psychotria of C. America (Taylor pers. comm.).

Psychotria pittieri;Obsolete;Palicourea cyanococca;psycpi;Rubiaceae;Standl.;Croat’s name, and we used in 1996 paper. Later switched to P. cyanococca, an earlier name for the same species found in Flora Nicaragua. 
Psychotria psychotriifolia;Accepted;Psychotria psychotriifolia;psycps;Rubiaceae;(Seem.) Standl.;Croat includes this, but it did not appear in the 50-ha plot until 1995 and is thus not in the 1996 paper.
Psychotria racemosa;Obsolete;Palicourea racemosa;psycra;Rubiaceae;Rich.;This is Croat’s name, and we used in 1996 paper. Moved to Psychotria following Borhidi2011.
Psychotria tenuifolia;Accepted;Psychotria tenuifolia;psycg2;Rubiaceae;Sw.;Formerly P. granadensis and published under that name in 1996 paper. Hamilton (1989) synonomized under this widespread S. American form, and Taylor (pers. comm.) agrees.
Pterocarpus belizense;Obsolete;Pterocarpus officinalis;pterbe;Fabaceae-papilionoideae;;An old misspelling of P. belizensis briefly in our database, never appearing in print. See notes with P. belizensis.
Pterocarpus belizensis;Obsolete;Pterocarpus officinalis;pterbe;Fabaceae-papilionoideae;Standl.;The 1996 paper uses this name for the rare BCI species, ie P. officianalis. Tropicos shows this as synonym of P. officianalis. But Henshold lists it as synonym of P. rohrii=P. hayesii, though that appears to be a misunderstanding. Robin believes he found a single specimen of a distinct Pterocarpus on BCI, ie a third species, and tentatively considered it was P. belizensis.
Pterocarpus hayesii;Accepted;Pterocarpus hayesii;pterro;Fabaceae-papilionoideae;Hemsl.;Formerly P. rohrii, and that old name was used in 1996 and 2004 papers.
Pterocarpus officinalis;Accepted;Pterocarpus officinalis;pterof;Fabaceae-papilionoideae;Jacq.;A swamp species, rare on BCI, only 9 in plot and dying off. We listed it as P. belizensis in 1996 paper,  but that appears to be a miscommunication. This has always been P. officianalis since Croat's identification.
Pterocarpus rohrii;Obsolete;Pterocarpus hayesii;pterro;Fabaceae-papilionoideae;Vahl;Croat’s name, and we followed in 1996 and 2004 papers. Later, following N. Zamora, we consider this P. hayesii, contra Tropicos. According to Zamora, P. hayesii and P. rohrii are different species, both valid, but P. rohrii is only in South America.
Quararibea asterolepis;Accepted;Quararibea asterolepis;quaras;Malvaceae;Pittier;Whether BCI specimens belong in Q. asterolepis subsp. stenophylla, Q. stenophylla, or Q. asterolepis, is unresolved at Tropicos.

Randia armata;Accepted;Randia armata;randar;Rubiaceae;(Sw.) DC.;
Randia formosa;Obsolete;Rosenbergiodendron formosum;randfo;Rubiaceae;;Croat's and our original name, and we used it in 1996 paper. This, with a small set of Randia species, were split off into a new genus, and from 2004 paper this became Rosenbergiodendron formosum
Rauvolfia littoralis;Accepted;Rauvolfia littoralis;rauvli;Apocynaceae;Rusby;Does not appear in Croat. Discovered on BCI in 50-ha plot in 1995 census.
Rheedia acuminata;Obsolete;Garcinia madruno;gar2ma;Clusiaceae;;Croat’s name, now Garcinia madruno. See notes with R. edulis and Hammel (1989). We never published this name because we had changed before 1996.
Rheedia edulis;Obsolete;Garcinia recondita;gar2in;Clusiaceae;;Croat’s name, but Garcinia intermedia in the 1996 paper, now Garcinia recondita. We never published Rheedia because we had changed before 1996. Need for moving Rheedia to Garcinia was noted as early as 1958 by Robson (on African flora). Rheedia had been New World, but traits separating it from Garcinia are inconsistent. Hammel (1989) assigned new combination G. intermedia, since G. edulis was not available. No change in species boundary. Hammel’s reidentification of BCI specimens as G. recondita still not published as of 2017 (Hammel pers. comm.) 
Rinorea sylvatica;Accepted;Rinorea sylvatica;rinosy;Violaceae;(Seem.) Kuntze;
Rosenbergiodendron formosum;Accepted;Rosenbergiodendron formosum;randfo;Rubiaceae;(Jacq.) Fagerl.;Formerly Randia formosa and appearing as such in 1996 paper, changed to Rosenbergiodendron formosum by 2004 paper. This and 3 other species were shown to be outside Randia (DNA and morphology). The species circumscription was nearly unchanged, though a Guyana segregate was split, so the new R. formosum has a slightly smaller range (Taylor pers. comm.).
Sapium aucuparium;Obsolete;Sapium glandulosum;sapiau;Euphorbiaceae;;We used this name in 1996 paper for what Croat called S. caudatum. Then Krujit (1996) moved S. aucuparium under S. glandulosum, which we have adopted. Specimens at Tropicos identified by R. Liesner as S. glandulosum. See notes under S. caudatum for further confusion about Croat’s names.
Sapium broadleaf;Accepted;Sapium broadleaf;sapisp;Euphorbiaceae;;
Sapium caudatum;Obsolete;Sapium glandulosum;sapiau;Euphorbiaceae;Pitt.;There has been much confusion about Sapium names. Croat used this name, but  Webster and Huft (1988) moved S. caudatum under S. aucuparium and discussed problems. We followed Croat and used S. caudatum when the 50-ha censuses started, but switched to S. aucuparium by the late 1980s. Croat also used S. aucuparium for a different taxon, but his description matches S. laurifolium. The latter, however, has never otherwise observed or collected at BCI, and that specimen should be S. glandulosum.
Sapium glandulosum;Accepted;Sapium glandulosum;sapiau;Euphorbiaceae;(L.) Morong;Krujit synonomized S. aucuparium with this. R. Liesner identifed BCI specimens as S. glandulosum. 
Sapium sp 1;Obsolete;Sapium broadleaf;sapisp;Euphorbiaceae;;We used this name in the 2004 paper for the Sapium in the Sherman plot. They match Sapium broadleaf, the yet-to-be-described new species at BCI.
Sapium sp. nov.;Obsolete;Sapium broadleaf;sapisp;Euphorbiaceae;;The name we used in 1996 paper for what we call Sapium broadleaf. We believe it is a new species, yet undescribed, and M. Huft (pers. comm.) confirms. The Foster BCI specimen from the 50-ha plot remains unnamed at Tropicos (Foster 2942).
Scheelea zonensis;Obsolete;Attalea rostrata;sch1zo;Arecaceae;;Croat’s name, and this appears in 1996 paper. Henderson eliminated Scheelea and moved into Attalea. This became A. butyracea in the 2004 paper.
Schefflera morototoni;Accepted;Schefflera morototoni;sch2mo;Araliaceae;(Aubl.) Maguire, Steyerm. & Frodin;We originally used Didymopanax morototoni for this, following Croat. But Frodin (1975) moved the entire genus Didymopanax into Schefflera, as new species added blurred distinctions. A DNA phylogeny confirmed this (Fiaschi & Plunkett 2011). We had the correct S. morototoni in the 1996 and 2004 papers.
Schizolobium parahyba;Accepted;Schizolobium parahyba;schipa;Fabaceae-caesalpinioideae;(Vell.) S.F. Blake;This is the correct spelling of Croat's S. parahybum. We had the bad spelling in 1996 paper but corrected in database afterwards.
Schizolobium parahybum;Obsolete;Schizolobium parahyba;schipa;Fabaceae-caesalpinioideae;;Croat used this misspelling of S. parahyba. We repeated the error in the 1996 paper. 
Senna dariensis;Accepted;Senna dariensis;sennda;Fabaceae-caesalpinioideae;(Britton & Rose) H.S. Irwin & Barneby;Formerly Cassia fruticosa, but we had corrected to Senna by the 1996 and 2004 papers. Irwin and Barneby 1982 split Cassia into 3 genera, including Senna. Reviewed in Marazzi, with DNA phylogeny confirming monophyly of Senna. Known as S. dariensis var. gatunensis in Tropicos.
Simarouba amara;Accepted;Simarouba amara;simaam;Simaroubaceae;Aubl.;
Siparuna cristata;Accepted;Siparuna cristata;sipacr;Siparunaceae;(Poepp. & Endl.) A. DC.;On BCI, this was formerly identified as S. guianensis, following Croat. Renner re-identified the Tropicos on BCI specimens as S. cristata in 1999. See notes with S. guianensis.
Siparuna guianensis;Obsolete;Siparuna cristata;sipagu;Siparunaceae;Aubl.;Croat used S. guianensis for the less common BCI species of Siparuna, but those in the BCI plot are now reidentified S. cristata. We used the old name in early 50-ha plot censuses and it appears as S. guianensis in the 1996 paper. Though no longer known on BCI, S. guianensis remains a valid species in Panama, with many Canal Area specimens at Tropicos still called S. guianensis. We currently retain the name in 3 other plots, though those specimens may yet be re-identified.

Sloanea terniflora;Accepted;Sloanea terniflora;sloate;Elaeocarpaceae;(Moc. & Sessé ex DC.) Standl.;
Socratea durissima;Obsolete;Socratea exorrhiza;socrex;Arecaceae;;Croat used this name, a Central American taxon, and we followed in the 1982 census. But Croat acknowledged the possibility it is not distinct from the South American, S. exorrhiza, and we had switched by the late 1980s and used the S. exorrhiza in 1996 and 2004 papers.
Socratea exorrhiza;Accepted;Socratea exorrhiza;socrex;Arecaceae;(Mart.) H.Wendl.;We used this in 1996 and 2004 papers, changing from Croat, who called this S. durissima. See notes there. Henderson (1997) lumped S. durissima with the S. American S. exorrhiza.
Solanum arboreum;Accepted;Solanum arboreum;solaar;Solanaceae;Dunal;
Solanum argenteum;Obsolete;Solanum lepidotum;solast;Solanaceae;Dunal;This is Croat’s name, and we used it in 1982. It is, however, an Incorrect identification, now S. lepidotum. We mistakenly called it S. steyemarkii in 1996 paper, which is wrong taxon and misspelled (should be S. steyermarkii).
Solanum asperum;Accepted;Solanum asperum;solaas;Solanaceae;Rich.;
Solanum circinatum;Accepted;Solanum circinatum;cyphha;Solanaceae;Bohs;Bohs (1995) collapsed entire genus Cyphomandra into Solanum. DNA phylogeny shows both it and Lycopersicon nested within Solanum. No change in species circumscription.
Solanum hayesii;Accepted;Solanum hayesii;solaha;Solanaceae;Fernald;
Solanum lepidotum;Accepted;Solanum lepidotum;solast;Solanaceae;Dunal;Nee says Panama and Andes specimens should be this, while E. Brazil specimens are different. So Brazil specimens were first argenteum, changed to lepidotum by Soto, changed back to argenteum by Nee
Solanum steyemarkii;Obsolete;Solanum lepidotum;solast;Solanaceae;;This is a misspelling of S. steyermarkii that appeared in our 1996 BCI paper. But the valid name is now S. lepidotum.
Solanum steyermarkii;Obsolete;Solanum lepidotum;solast;Solanaceae;Carvalho;Carvalho's describes this species as new and attributes all BCI specimens (including Robin's) to it. But there is much doubt: elevation range is otherwise given as > 500 m, and height range to 35 m. Knapp et al (2005) and Tropicos now reject it. Nee gives this as alt name for FMNH specimens of lepidotum.

Sterculia apetala;Accepted;Sterculia apetala;sterap;Malvaceae;(Jacq.) H.Karst.;
Stylogyne standleyi;Obsolete;Stylogyne turbacensis;stylst;Myrsinaceae;;Croat used this name, a taxon described from BCI. We followed Croat, and this name appears in 1996 and 2004 papers. Ricketson and Pipoly (1997) synonomized under the wide-ranging S. turbacensis, saying that across the range, characters of several local taxa overlap with S. turbacensis.
Stylogyne turbacensis;Accepted;Stylogyne turbacensis;stylst;Myrsinaceae;(Kunth) Mez;Formerly S. standleyi, in both 1996 and 2004 paper. We since switched to S. turbacensis, following the monograph of Ricketson and Pipoly (1997).

Tachigalia versicolor;Obsolete;Tachigali panamensis;tachve;Fabaceae-caesalpinioideae;;This is Croat’s misspelling of T. versicolor. We had it corrected by the 1996 paper, but used it in our own database for sometime before that.
Tachigali panamensis;Accepted;Tachigali panamensis;tachve;Fabaceae-caesalpinioideae;van der Werff & N.Zamora;Formerly T. versicolor, following Croat, but van der Werff in 2010 erected this new name for Panama specimens. This appears as T. versicolor in 1996 and 2004 papers.
Tachigali versicolor;Obsolete;Tachigali panamensis;tachve;Fabaceae-caesalpinioideae;Standl. & L.O.Williams;Croat’s name, and we used through 2015, including 1996 and 2004 papers.

Tovomitopsis nicaraguensis;Obsolete;Chrysochlamys eclipes;chr1ec;Clusiaceae;Oerst., Planch. & Triana;"Croat used this name, but it is a double error. First, Tovomitopsis has been  synonomized with Chrysoclamys more often than not for over 100 years; Hammel (1999) cleared this up in favor of Chrysoclamys. Second, C. nicaraguensis remains a valid species, but quite distinct, and not on BCI, where C. eclipes is correct. Hammel (1999) provides a clear explanation of all."
Trattinnickia aspera;Accepted;Trattinnickia aspera;tratas;Burseraceae;(Standl.) Swart;
Trema integerrima;Accepted;Trema integerrima;tremin;Cannabaceae;(Beurl.) Standl.;Croat mentioned this taxon, but did not consider it present on BCI. In 2010, we reassessed the genus and recognized several individuals in the 50-ha plot as belonging to T. integerrima, formerly identified as T. micrantha. See notes with Trema unidentified.
Trema micrantha;Accepted;Trema micrantha;tremmi;Cannabaceae;(L.) Blume;All Trema in the 50-ha plot were identified as this species until 2010. But several individuals that had been alive prior to 2010 (one back to 1990) were reidentified, forcing us to reassess the genus. See notes with Trema unidentified.
Trema unidentified;Accepted;Trema unidentified;tremsp;Cannabaceae;;Because we reassessed the genus in 2010, any individuals of Trema that had died earlier could not be reidentified, and all are now called Trema unidentified.

Trichilia cipo;Obsolete;Trichilia tuberculata;tri2tu;Meliaceae;(A. Juss.) C. DC.;Croat's misidentification of T. tuberculata, but Pennington corrected by 1981, also in Pennington (2016). T. cipo is valid but only in S. America. We had changed to T. tuberculata before the plot census began, following Pennington (1981). Tropicos still has Panama specimens, including Croat’s from BCI, under the erroneous T. cipo.
Trichilia montana;Obsolete;Trichilia pallida;tri2pa;Meliaceae;;Croat's name, but we had changed to T. pallida before the plot census began, following Pennington in Fl. Neotrop.

Vasconcellea cauliflora;Accepted;Vasconcellea cauliflora;carica;Caricaceae;(Jacq.) A.DC.;This species appears in Croat as Carica cauliflora, but the species was not found in the 50-ha plot until 2010. We identified it in other plots in the 1990s, though, using the old name, but it is now updated to V. califlora in our database. (Badillo 2000 in Ernstia).
Verbesina gigantea;Accepted;Verbesina gigantea;verbgi;Asteraceae;Jacq.;Croat included this taxon, but it was not identified in the 50-ha plot until the 2000 census and thus does not appear in 1996 paper.
Virola bozo;Obsolete;Virola multiflora;virosp;Myristicaceae;;Our original name in 1982 for a Virola not matching any known BCI species. In the 1996 paper, it appears as Virola sp. nov., as if it was a novel species. But it was later identified as V. multiflora
Virola multiflora;Accepted;Virola multiflora;virosp;Myristicaceae;(Standl.) A.C.Sm.;Labeled as unidentified morphospecies V. bozo in original BCI census, and listed as Virola sp. nov. in 1996 paper. By the 2004 paper, it was identified and appears as V. mutliflora there.
Virola nobilis;Accepted;Virola nobilis;virosu;Myristicaceae;A.C. Sm.;Croat published V. surinamensis for the tallest BCI Virola, but lists V. nobilis as a synonym, and originally identified specimens as V. nobilis. Later, Gentry incorrectly reidentified as V. surinamensis. Rodriguez in 2007 identified BCI specimens as V. nobilis, but Tropicos has both names in Panama and Costa Rica.
